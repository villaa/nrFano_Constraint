The cross sections in this directory were made with the "limitcode.git" code, aailable from the git respository on nero.

The main code called is highstat/drdq_corr.m.

I used  highstat/rundata/CDMSliteR2/scripts/computeLimit_bestFit_si_CDMSliteR2.m as a guide, which does not set the "haloPar" argument.
