<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>
The "effective" Fano factor for nuclear recoils is something that has been studied before both
theoretically [<a href="papers/Lindhard2.pdf">Lind63a</a>, <a
		  href="papers/Lindhard3.pdf">Lind63b</a>, <a
		  href="papers/Lindhard1.pdf">Lind68</a>] and experimentally [<a
    href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.45.2104">Doug91</a>].  This
    factor parameterizes the variance in the ionization produced from nuclear recoils, and is
    strongly dependent on the recoil energy of the nuclear recoils. In order to study how new data
    from CDMS&nbsp;II, SuperCDMS, and Edelweiss may constrain the variance for germanium we have
    to understand the previous theoretical predictions and experimental constraints for silicon.
    Here I show what information on the silicon predictions and measurements I've gathered and how
    that information is relevant to the germanium case.

<h3 id="epsilon">1. Lindhard energy definition</h3>
<br>
<b>Energy Definition:</b>
<br>
<p>
Lindhard [<a href="papers/Lindhard3.pdf">Lind63b</a>] defines the dimensionless energy as follows. 
</p>
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = E \frac{aM_1}{Z_1 Z_2 e^2(M_1+M_2)},
\end{equation}
<p>
where $M_1$, $Z_1$, $M_2$, and $Z_2$ are the masses and atomic numbers of the projectile
(subscript 1) and target (subscript 2) respectively. E is the energy of the projectile in any energy units. 
</p>
<p>
From this expression, and how the variable $e$ appears, I figured out that it is in Guassian-cgs
units [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_units">Gauss-cgs</a>] where charge-squared
has units of energy times distance. Since the only remaining dimensionful quantity in the
expression (other than the energy) is $a$, the "radius" of the screened potential, the factor
after the energy on the RHS has dimensions of inverse energy. So $\epsilon$ is dimensionless. 
</p>
<p>
The value for $a$ used by Lindhard [<a href="papers/Lindhard3.pdf">Lind63b</a>] is as follows. 
</p>
\begin{equation}
a = 0.8853 \frac{a_0}{\left(Z_1^{\frac{2}{3}} + Z_2^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}},
\end{equation}
<p>
where $a_0$ is the Bohr radius. The Bohr radius in Gaussian units is simply $\hbar^2/m_e e^2$ [
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius">Bohr-rad</a>]. In order to not have to deal
with the "Statcoulomb" unit, I simply used this expression to replace the electric charge $e$ and
propagated it to the expression for $\epsilon$. If I also convert to natural units ($c = \hbar =
1$), I get this expression: 
</p>
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = E\cdot 0.8853\frac{a_0^2 m_e M_1}{(M_1+M_2)}\frac{1}{Z_1 Z_2 \left(Z_1^{\frac{2}{3}} +
Z_2^{\frac{2}{3}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}} ,
\end{equation}
<p>
Since in our analysis and many "active-detector" measurements the recoiling species is the same as
the projectile species, we can make the substitution $Z \equiv Z_1 = Z_2$ and $M_1 = M_2$ to get:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = E\cdot 0.8853\frac{a_0^2 m_e}{2\sqrt{2} Z^2 Z^{\frac{1}{3}}} ,
\end{equation}
<p>
In natural units the Bohr radius equals 2.68$\times$10$^{-4}$ /eV (which equals 0.268 /keV) and $m_e$ is 511&nbsp;keV. Also,
$Z$ is 32 for germanium and 14 for silicon. That means for germanium: 
</p>
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{Ge} = \mathrm{0.00353} \cdot E_{Ge} \mathrm{(keV)},
\end{equation}
<p>
and for silicon:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{Si} = \mathrm{0.02432} \cdot E_{Si} \mathrm{(keV)},
\end{equation}
<p>
These definitions seem to match the Sorensen paper [<a
	href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.91.083509">Sor15</a>],
because $\epsilon$=0.1 corresponds to 28.3&nbsp;keV and 4.11&nbsp; for germanium and silicon
respectively. This correspondence is confirmed by Figures&nbsp;1&amp;3 of that paper respectively.
<br>
<br>
<b>Variance in Ionization Production and the Effective Fano Factor:</b>
<br>
<p>
Using this non-dimensional energy, Lindhard et al. parameterize the energy deposition balance for a nuclear recoil as:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \nu(\epsilon) + \eta(\epsilon),
\end{equation}
<p>
where $\nu$ is the energy given to the lattice (phonons) and $\eta$ is the energy given to the
electron system (e/h pairs). The total energy deposited is fixed and assumed to be equal to the
incoming energy, but the sharing of energy can be a function of the incoming energy. This makes
the standard definition of "ionization yield:" $Y=\bar{\eta}/\epsilon$, where the bar
indicates the average for many identical recoils. The variance in the energy given to the
electronic system is denoted (following Lindhard) as $\Omega^2$. Note that due to the constrained
total energy deposit this must also be the variance of the lattice energy.
</p>
<p>
The standard Fano factor, F, is defined as follows:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\sigma_N = \sqrt{F\bar{N}},
\end{equation}
<p>
where $\sigma_N$ is the standard deviation of the number of ionization pairs produced, and $\bar{N}$
is the average number of pairs produced. This equation basically is an analog to the
counting-statistics variance from Poisson statistics; if the Fano factor is unity the distribution
agrees with the Poisson distribution up to the second moment. 
</p>
<p>
The fractional variance for the electronic energy is $\sigma_N/\bar{N}$ and in terms of Lindhard
parameters this is $\Omega/\eta$. And, since $\bar{\eta} = Y\epsilon$, we can write the effective
Fano factor like:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\tilde{F} = \bar{N} \frac{1}{Y^2} \left(\frac{\Omega}{\epsilon}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
<p>
The ratio of the variance in ionization production to the total energy of the recoil has been
measured for silicon by Dougherty [<a
	href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.45.2104">Doug91</a>]. And The
ionization yield for silicon can be taken from the Lindhard paper with the parameter k=0.15. This
will allow one to put Dougherty's measurements into the context of the effective Fano factor
$\tilde{F}$. 
</p>


<br>
<h3 id="dough">2. Dougherty paper</h3>
<p>
The measurement by Dougherty [<a
	href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.45.2104">Doug91</a>] was done
by using neutrons to scatter off of silicon and looking for features in the resulting recoil
spectrum. The experiment used the $^7$Li(p,n)$^7$Be reaction to produce neutrons via a proton
source of around 1.8&ndash;2.7&nbsp;MeV. Each proton energy produced a different maximum neutron
energy. It was a "thick-target" experiment so the protons slowed to a stop in the
neutron-production target and ensured that neutrons of all energies up to the maximum were
produced. 
</p>
<p>
The neutron scatters were observed in a silicon ionization detector with threshold of 0.5&nbsp;keV
ionization energy. Because of resonance structures in silicon for incoming neutron energies of
815, 566, 189, 56, and 31&nbsp;keV, features are observed in the recoil spectrum. Generally the
changes in elastic cross section will cause the recoil spectra to have a feature when one moves
above the maximum recoil energy from a resonant-energy neutron. 
</p>
<p>
Near the features in slope of the recoil energy spectra there is an inflection due to the resonant
features that can be extracted by looking at a "derivative filter" of the recoil spectrum. The
simple filter used is:
</p>
\begin{equation}
\Delta N(k) /n \equiv \left[\sum_{i=k+1}^{k+n} N(i) - \sum_{i=k-n-1}^{k} N(i)\right]/n,
\end{equation}
<p>
where $n$ was specifically chosen for each neutron energy to emphasize the inflection point.
</p>
<p>
Table&nbsp;1 shows the relevant data from the Dougherty paper.

<h3 id="lindx">3. Lindhard extraction and plot </h3>
<br>
<p>
In order to be sure I understood all of the details of the Dougherty paper and its relation to the
Lindhard papers, I decided to re-plot the Fig.&nbsp;2 of Dougherty, and overlay my own extraction
of the Lindhard model for the ionization variance. Python&nbsp;Code&nbsp;Block&nbsp;1 below (use the show/hide
button to reveal) shows the Jupyter notebook that I used to accomplish the analysis.

First I extracted the Dougherty data (see Fig.&nbsp;1 (left)) from his Fig.&nbsp;2. This was
straight-forward to do with "Data Thief" but it was a bit difficult because the lines for the
theory models were not contiguous and had poor contrast. So I ended up tracing them with a
fine-point sharpie marker and then using Data Thief [<a
	href="https://www.datathief.org/">Data-Thief</a>]. I used <a
	href='pics/Dougherty_fig2.png'>this</a> figure to extract the curves shown on the
Dougherty plot (see Fig.&nbsp;1 (left), black solid and dashed lines). 
</p>
<p>
To get the $\Omega/\epsilon$ information I used <a href='pics/Lindhard_NACIII_fig8.png'>Fig. 8</a>
of the Lindhard "Notes on Atomic Collisons III" (NACIII) paper [<a
href="papers/Lindhard3.pdf">Lind63b</a>]. I used the same technique of tracing them with a
fine-point sharpie (red and green).

<p>
Figure&nbsp;1 shows that the technique of tracing was a little unstable but I was able in the end
to obtain the same graph as Dougherty and also confirm that the estimates for the theoretical
$\Omega/\epsilon$ came from the Lindhard NACIII paper Fig.&nbsp;8. When I converted the ratio into
the effective Fano factor using the equations of Sec.&nbsp;1 (and a $k$=0.15 for the Lindhard
model of the silicon ionization yield) I get Figure&nbsp;1 (right). The effective Fano factor gets
to over 200 times larger than the standard Poisson fluctuation (Fano of one). 
</p>

<br>
<h3 id="furtherwork">4. further work</h3>

<p>
This note is pretty simple and self-contained. The technique is interesting and that might be good
to study more in the future, but is not relevant on the short timescale. Here are some areas of
further work related to this:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Try to get better specifications of the Lindhard and Dougherty curves for the theoretical
	 predictions for the ionization variance (and therefore the effective Fano factor too).
 </li>
 <br>
 <li>Get a double-check on the conversion from ionization variance to the effective Fano factor.</li> 
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h3 id="conclusion">5. conclusions</h3>

<p>
I was able to extract the data from the Dougherty paper and convert it to the effective Fano
factor. Furthermore, I was able to match the theoretical predictions from the Dougherty paper
where he quoted the Lindhard predictions, by taking the original predictions from that paper and
converting the energy scale ($\epsilon$ relations in Sec.&nbsp;1) and converting to the
appropriate percent scale that Dougherty used for the "excess" ionization variance. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Note that the effective Fano factors are quite large for silicon near 100&nbsp;keV recoils,
	over 200 times wider than a Poisson fluctuation. This result should be checked.</li>
