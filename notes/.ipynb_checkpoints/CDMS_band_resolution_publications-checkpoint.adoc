Thesis, Mark Pepin

* phonon resolution information for CDMSlite R2 detector
* information on **projected** SNOLAB resolutions 
* cites resolution fits by D. Moore in ebook, D. Moore, Low Threshold Analysis Cuts and Eciencies," CDMS Intern. Run 123 Anal. Eb. (2009).
* gives functional form of efficiency fit in eq'n 7.1, page 135
* figure with ER, NR bands for unspecified CDMSII detector, fig 4.11 pg. 90

== Simulating The Supercdms Dark Matter Detector Response And Readout
Thesis, Allison Kennedy

* oZIP bands, fig 2.14.  Figure from Anthony, so maybe re-analysis fig?
* nice description of optimal filter
* charge resolutions for 100-mm G106a given for 0, 10.4, 59.5, 356 keV at detector bias of 4V
* states that Soudan iZIP resolutions vary from 291 eV to 455 eV, cites Dan Jardin's note
* states that Soudan fits used peaks up to 511 keV, cites D. Jardin's note, pg. 201
* plots resultion of 10.36 keV for multiple bias voltages (not clear it's for G106a?)
* charge resolutions for 100-mm G106a given for 0, 10.4, 59.5, 356 keV at detector bias of 4V, table 5.2, pg. 193
* plots phonon resultion of 10.36 keV for multiple bias voltages (not clear it's for G106a?), pg. 194, mentions plot includes Luke gain?
* plots phonon resultion of 10.36 keV for multiple bias voltages again. pg. 205, without Luke-gain warning
* functional form of resolution given in eq. 5.2, pg 198, final fit parameters not given (I don't think)
* G106a with 4V bias phonon and charge resolution fits shown in fig. 5.28, pg. 201
* G106a phonon and charge resolution shown against ALL R133 resolutions, fig 5.29 pg. 202.  Upper part of curves severely obscured by legend.
* R129 bands given for T1Z2, fig 5.30 pg. 204, cites internal note
* G106a with 4V bias bands are shown on pg. 205, pg. 208 with band-fit information
* functional forms of ER and NR bands given, pg. 207
* fit range and energy binning for ER, NR bands given (pg. 206) but not final fit parameters (?)
* PDFs for NR and ER recoil energy for simulated bands for G106a given, as well as yield model, pg. 202, 203
* gives total number of events in bands (I think) on pg. 213
* Gaussian-Cauchy distribution is mentioned in checks on leakage, pg. 209

== Dedicated Searches For Low And High Mass Wimps With The SuperCDMS Soudan iZIP Detectors
Thesis, Brad Welliver

* T3Z1 bands shown in fig 4-3, unclear if parameterization given
* states typical range for noise resolution of ionization channels 
* plots phonon-channel noise resolution as a function of time for T2Z2
* mentions that phonon noise resolution varies by 20% from run to run
* No obvious discussion/reporting of charge of phonon resolution of CDMSII or SuperCDMS detectors

== TESTING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SUPERCDMS DARK MATTER DETECTORS
Thesis, Benjamin Shank

* No bands
* No obvious discussion/reporting of charge of phonon resolution of CDMSII or SuperCDMS detectors
* Focuses more on simulating processes in detector, TES response
