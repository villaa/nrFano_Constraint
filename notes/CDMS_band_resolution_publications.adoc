== Low-Mass Dark Matter Search Results and Radiogenic Backgrounds for the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search
Thesis, Mark Pepin

* phonon resolution information for CDMSlite R2 detector
* information on **projected** SNOLAB resolutions 
* cites resolution fits by D. Moore in ebook, D. Moore, Low Threshold Analysis Cuts and Eciencies," CDMS Intern. Run 123 Anal. Eb. (2009).
* gives functional form of efficiency fit in eq'n 7.1, page 135
* figure with ER, NR bands for unspecified CDMSII detector, fig 4.11 pg. 90

== Simulating The Supercdms Dark Matter Detector Response And Readout
Thesis, Allison Kennedy

== Dedicated Searches For Low And High Mass Wimps With The SuperCDMS Soudan iZIP Detectors
Thesis, Brad Welliver

* T3Z1 bands shown in fig 4-3, unclear if parameterization given
* states typical range for noise resolution of ionization channels 
* plots phonon-channel noise resolution as a function of time for T2Z2
* mentions that phonon noise resolution varies by 20% from run to run
* No obvious discussion/reporting of charge of phonon resolution of CDMSII or SuperCDMS detectors

== TESTING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SUPERCDMS DARK MATTER DETECTORS
Thesis, Benjamin Shank

* No bands
* No obvious discussion/reporting of charge of phonon resolution of CDMSII or SuperCDMS detectors
* Focuses more on simulating processes in detector, TES response
