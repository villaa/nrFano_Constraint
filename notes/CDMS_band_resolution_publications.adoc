== Dedicated Searches For Low And High Mass Wimps With The SuperCDMS Soudan iZIP Detectors
Thesis, Brad Welliver

* T3Z1 bands shown in fig 4-3, unclear if parameterization given
* states typical range for noise resolution of ionization channels 
* plots phonon-channel noise resolution as a function of time for T2Z2
* mentions that phonon noise resolution varies by 20% from run to run
* No obvious discussion/reporting of charge of phonon resolution of CDMSII or SuperCDMS detectors

== TESTING AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SUPERCDMS DARK MATTER DETECTORS
Thesis, Benjamin Shank

* No bands
* No obvious discussion/reporting of charge of phonon resolution of CDMSII or SuperCDMS detectors
* Focuses more on simulating processes in detector, TES response
