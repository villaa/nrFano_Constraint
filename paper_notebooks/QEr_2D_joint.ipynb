    "# Joint Distributions of Q and $\\tilde{E}_r$ to Compare to Edelweiss Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to detail the computation of the joint distribution of Q and $\\tilde{E}_r$ (measured ionization yield and measured recoil energy) with and arbitrary effective Fano factor applied. The construction used here is different from the one of Arvind, but it is verified to produce the same results for the probability distribution in ionization yield (called \"Q\" by Edelweiss) at a given fixed true recoil energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a table of the variables used in computing the distribution. I match Edelweiss variable names where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "variable/constant name|Description \n",
    ":-|:-\n",
    "Q|measured ionization yield (CDMS calls this \"Y\")\n",
    "$\\tilde{E}_r$|measured recoil energy\n",
    "N|number of e/h pairs\n",
    "$\\delta I$ | instrumental fluctuation on the ionization measurement\n",
    "$\\delta H$ | instrumental fluctuation on the heat measurement\n",
    "$E_r$ | true recoil energy\n",

    "$V$ |voltage across the detector in Volts\n",
    "F | effective Fano factor for nuclear-recoils\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek the joint distribution of Q and $\\tilde{E}_r$ given a fixed true energy, $E_r$. It is equal to the 5-variable joint distribution integrated appropriately over the 3 unwanted variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P(Q,\\tilde{E}_r | E_r) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d(\\delta H) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d(\\delta I) \\int_0^{\\infty} dN\n",
    " P(Q,\\tilde{E}_r,\\delta H,\\delta I, N | E_r)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique used is to write down the 5-variable joint distribution based on the rules of conditional probability and the fact that N, $\\delta I$, and $\\delta H$ are independent random variables. Then the appropriate integrals can be carried out analytically or numerically. "

    "## Resolutions and the Conditional Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the variables already defined we need some kind of specifications for the (assumed Gaussian) resolutions on the three fundamental measured variables: N, $\\delta I$, and $\\delta H$. The resolutions are denoted $\\sigma_N$, $\\sigma_I$, and $\\sigma_H$ respectively, and are assumed to be functions of the true recoil energy $E_r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the $\\sigma_I$ and the $\\sigma_H$ are just the measured resolutions from Edelweiss paper [REF]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\sigma_N$ is the standard deviation of the number of electron-hole pairs, which can be computed (for a fixed $E_r$) using the effective Fano factor F. It is given simply by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma_N = \\sqrt{F(\\bar{Q}E_r/\\epsilon)},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\bar{Q}$ is the mean ionization yield at $E_r$. Whenever $\\bar{Q}$ is written it is tacitly assumed to be a function of the true recoil energy, $E_r$."
