    "# Joint Distributions of $E_p$ and $E_q$ with SuperCDMS Goal Resolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to detail the calculation of the joint distribution of $E_p$ and $E_q$ (the phonon and ionization energies) for SuperCDMS iZIP detectors with the SuperCDMS SNOLAB goal resolutions. Specifically, we are interested in at which energy the electron-recoil (ER) and nuclear-recoil (NR) bands overlap for a given effective nuclear-recoil Fano factor. The lower this energy is the more low-mass reach the iZIP SuperCDMS search will have in an essentially background-free environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the notebook `QEr_2D_joint.ipynb` we will build up the distributions from conditional probability arguments beginning with the random variables and constants in the following table. \n",

    "$V$ |voltage across the detector in Volts\n",
    "F | effective Fano factor for nuclear-recoils\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek the joint distribution of $E_p$ and $E_q$ given a fixed true energy, $E_r$. It is equal to the 5-variable joint distribution integrated appropriately over the 3 unwanted variables. \n",
    "\n",

    " P(E_p,E_q,\\delta P,\\delta Q, N | E_r)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique used is to write down the 5-variable joint distribution based on the rules of conditional probability and the fact that N, $\\delta P$, and $\\delta Q$ are independent random variables. Then the appropriate integrals can be carried out analytically or numerically."
